## Comments
This Hackintosh build may NOT fully work in your default conditions. Please KNOW YOUR HARDWARE and also be aware as what is supported under Apple flag and make changes accordingly. If you have the components verbatim to mine then go right ahead and use this repo. This will be true for any laptop having these components. This guide has been tested on MacOS Catalina 10.15.3 and 10.15.5. Also read through all the available material/guides/FAQs and double check everything before committing changes.

I replaced my WiFi card from DW1810 to DW1820a and HDD to SSD.
